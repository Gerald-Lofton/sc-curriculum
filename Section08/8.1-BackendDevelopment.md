## 3 Tier Application Architecture

The 3 Tier Application Architecture is made up of 3 portions as follows:

![3 Tier Application Architecture Diagram](../Section07/img/3TierArchitecture.png)

- Presentation Tier:
  - Presents the user with an interface to interact
  - Stores session data and makes requests and handles responses to/from the application tier
  - Written or transcoded to JavaScript
  - This is considered Frontend Development
- Application Tier:
  - Handles communication between presentation and data layers
  - Establishes business requirements such as authentication, authorization and validation
  - Can be written in any number of server side programming languages including Python, Java and now JavaScript.
  - This is considered Backend Development
- Data Tier:
  - Persists the data for the application tier.
  - The presentation and data tiers should never communicate directly.
  - Typical an SQL or NoSQL database server
  - The Data Tier could be the responsibility of developers, DevOps, or DBAs (Database Administrators) depending on the organization

## What is Backend Development

Backend refers to the server side of the website; it is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine.

<br>

So far, we've been using JavaScript in the browser to give our users richer experiences in the web.

But the JavaScript _language_ that we've been using in these browsers needs additional code to manage all of the housekeeping tasks that make JavaScript so simple to work with (like memory management, eventing, and optimization).

That additional code is called a **runtime**, and every browser includes some kind of JavaScript-specific runtime.

In addition to that runtime, browsers expose some of their functionality to the JavaScript runtime through many of the browser-specific Objects and APIs that we've already encountered (like the global `window` object and the DOM).

<br>

## Node.js

But those browser-specific helpers are not an intrinsic part of either JavaScript-the-_language_ or the _runtimes_ that power that language.

One might imagine, then, that the JavaScript runtimes that we've been using up to this point might be able to be separated entirely from the browser and run as their own process, giving JavaScript the power to run _anywhere_!

This is exactly what happened with the development of the browser-less JavaScript runtime called Node.js.

Today, Node.js is used from satellites, to servers, to command-lines, to text editors!

As you might recall from the very first class, we've been using many of these tools from the beginning: `npm`, `parcel`, `eslint` and even VS Code are written in JavaScript as Node applications.

## Node vs Browser JavaScript

### REPL

We've extensively used the REPL in Chrome's console tab to try out functions or debug existing applications. Node.js _also_ includes a REPL, accessible in your terminal with the command `node`.

Unlike the browser's REPL, `node` doesn't give us access to auto-suggestions or return previews. To exit Node's REPL, use `CTRL + D` or type `.exit`

<br>

### Global Object

While JavaScript-the-language is mostly the same between Node and evergreen browsers, one of the biggest difference between the two platforms is the name of the global object. We know that in the browser the global object is `window`, but in Node the global object is `global`

<br>

---

<br>

### Activity 1: Explore `global`

1. Run [7.3.1-Evr-Global.js](../Section07/Activities/7.3-Activities/7.3.1-Global.js) in the terminal
2. Notice that we still have access to many of the global timer methods from the browser (i.e. `setTimeout` and `setInterval`), but most of the rest of the `window` is missing.

<br>

---

<br>

## Modules: CommonJS vs ES6

Module syntax is another major difference between JS in the Node and browser.
By default, Node.js uses CommonJS module syntax. This module system predates the `import`/`export` statements we've been using for browser modules so far, but maps well to our current understanding of modules:

| Browsers (ES6 modules)                   | Node (CommonJS)                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `import DefaultThing from 'some-module'` | `const DefaultThing = require('some-module')`                  |
| `import { Thing } from 'some-module'`    | `const { DefaultThing } = require('some-module')`              |
| `export default DefaultThing`            | `module.exports = DefaultThing`                                |
| `export Thing`                           | `module.exports = { Thing }` or `module.exports.Thing = Thing` |

<br>

Notice that CommonJS modules are imported with a globally-availabe `require()` function, and are exported through the `exports` property of a module-level Object called `module`.

<br>

<br>

### Activity 2: Examine CommonJS modules

1. Examine [mathUtilities.js](../Section07/Activities/7.3-Activities/mathUtilities.js) and note the CommonJS export syntax
2. Examine [7.3.2-CommonJSModules.js](../Section07/Activities/7.3-Activities/7.3.2-CommonJSModules.js) and note the use of `require()` to import
3. Run [7.3.2-CommonJSModules.js](../Section07/Activities/7.3-Activities/7.3.2-CommonJSModules.js) to see the result of our module.

## Built-in Modules

Node.js contains a number of built-in modules that you can `require` and use in your code. There are different modules that you can bring in depending on what goal you're trying to accomplish.

Here are a few:

- `path`: provides utilities for working with **file and directory paths**; helps normalize paths, determine file extensions, and return specific parts of a file path
- `crypto`: provides utilities for **cryptographic functionality**; useful for creating hashes or working with private/public key infrastructure
- `fs`: provides utilities for interacting with the **file system**; how we create, read, update, and delete files from the computer
- `http`: used to create and handle HTTP requests and responses

> You can learn more about the different built-in modules in the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/)

### HTTP and RESTful APIs in more depth

Throughout the course, we've been working with API data and services from third parties like JSON Placeholder, `openweathermap.org`, and GitHub.

To do so, we've been leveraging the same request and response model used behind-the-scenes by browsers to fetch HTML, submit form data, and download files.

As we've seen before when working with `fetch` and `axios`, we can use JavaScript to leverage the same communication protocol used by the browser itself (called HTTP, or **H**yper **T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) to interact with API services that understand HTTP requests.

While HTTP is not the only way to interact with external services, it is by far the most common because of the browser's native support.

Now that we're building our own APIs to handle HTTP requests, let's take a closer look at what goes into an HTTP request and response.

<br>

## HTTP Servers

While working with file systems is very useful, Node's event-driven model and penchant for asynchronous programming mean that it really shines when used to serve content to thousands of requests at a time.

We often refer to the computers that listen to such requests "**servers**", and you'll often hear Node referred to as a _"server-side" JavaScript runtime_.

Because these hardware servers are rarely running anything other than a collection of applications to handle requests, those _applications_ are _also_ often called "_servers_" themselves.

The most common way for web applications (like the ones we've been building so far) to make requests of servers is through **HTTP**.

In our practice SPA, let's build our own application (or "service" or "server") to serve up content for web applications!
