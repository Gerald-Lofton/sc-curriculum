## 3 Tier Application Architecture

The 3 Tier Application Architecture is made up of 3 portions as follows:

![3 Tier Application Architecture Diagram](../Section07/img/3TierArchitecture.png)

- Presentation Tier:
  - Presents the user with an interface to interact
  - Stores session data and makes requests and handles responses to/from the application tier
  - Written or transcoded to JavaScript
  - This is considered Frontend Development
- Application Tier:
  - Handles communication between presentation and data layers
  - Establishes business requirements such as authentication, authorization and validation
  - Can be written in any number of server side programming languages including Python, Java and now JavaScript.
  - This is considered Backend Development
- Data Tier:
  - Persists the data for the application tier.
  - The presentation and data tiers should never communicate directly.
  - Typical an SQL or NoSQL database server
  - The Data Tier could be the responsibility of developers, DevOps, or DBAs (Database Administrators) depending on the organization

## What is Backend Development

Backend refers to the server side of the website; it is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine.

<br>

So far, we've been using JavaScript in the browser to give our users richer experiences in the web.

But the JavaScript _language_ that we've been using in these browsers needs additional code to manage all of the housekeeping tasks that make JavaScript so simple to work with (like memory management, eventing, and optimization).

That additional code is called a **runtime**, and every browser includes some kind of JavaScript-specific runtime.

In addition to that runtime, browsers expose some of their functionality to the JavaScript runtime through many of the browser-specific Objects and APIs that we've already encountered (like the global `window` object and the DOM).

<br>

## Node.js

But those browser-specific helpers are not an intrinsic part of either JavaScript-the-_language_ or the _runtimes_ that power that language.

One might imagine, then, that the JavaScript runtimes that we've been using up to this point might be able to be separated entirely from the browser and run as their own process, giving JavaScript the power to run _anywhere_!

This is exactly what happened with the development of the browser-less JavaScript runtime called Node.js.

Today, Node.js is used from satellites, to servers, to command-lines, to text editors!

As you might recall from the very first class, we've been using many of these tools from the beginning: `npm`, `parcel`, `eslint` and even VS Code are written in JavaScript as Node applications.

<br>

<br>

## Node vs Browser JavaScript

### REPL

We've extensively used the REPL in Chrome's console tab to try out functions or debug existing applications. Node.js _also_ includes a REPL, accessible in your terminal with the command `node`.

Unlike the browser's REPL, `node` doesn't give us access to auto-suggestions or return previews. To exit Node's REPL, use `CTRL + D` or type `.exit`

<br>

### Global Object

While JavaScript-the-language is mostly the same between Node and evergreen browsers, one of the biggest difference between the two platforms is the name of the global object. We know that in the browser the global object is `window`, but in Node the global object is `global`

<br>

---

<br>

### Activity 1: Explore `global`

1. Run [7.3.1-Evr-Global.js](../Section07/Activities/7.3-Activities/7.3.1-Global.js) in the terminal
2. Notice that we still have access to many of the global timer methods from the browser (i.e. `setTimeout` and `setInterval`), but most of the rest of the `window` is missing.

<br>

---

<br>

## Modules: CommonJS vs ES6

Module syntax is another major difference between JS in the Node and browser.
By default, Node.js uses CommonJS module syntax. This module system predates the `import`/`export` statements we've been using for browser modules so far, but maps well to our current understanding of modules:

| Browsers (ES6 modules)                   | Node (CommonJS)                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `import DefaultThing from 'some-module'` | `const DefaultThing = require('some-module')`                  |
| `import { Thing } from 'some-module'`    | `const { DefaultThing } = require('some-module')`              |
| `export default DefaultThing`            | `module.exports = DefaultThing`                                |
| `export Thing`                           | `module.exports = { Thing }` or `module.exports.Thing = Thing` |

<br>

Notice that CommonJS modules are imported with a globally-availabe `require()` function, and are exported through the `exports` property of a module-level Object called `module`.

<br>

---

<br>

### Activity 2: Examine CommonJS modules

1. Examine [mathUtilities.js](../Section07/Activities/7.3-Activities/mathUtilities.js) and note the CommonJS export syntax
2. Examine [7.3.2-CommonJSModules.js](../Section07/Activities/7.3-Activities/7.3.2-CommonJSModules.js) and note the use of `require()` to import
3. Run [7.3.2-CommonJSModules.js](../Section07/Activities/7.3-Activities/7.3.2-CommonJSModules.js) to see the result of our module.

<br>

---

<br>

## Built-in Modules

Node.js contains a number of built-in modules that you can `require` and use in your code. There are different modules that you can bring in depending on what goal you're trying to accomplish.

Here are a few:

- `path`: provides utilities for working with **file and directory paths**; helps normalize paths, determine file extensions, and return specific parts of a file path
- `crypto`: provides utilities for **cryptographic functionality**; useful for creating hashes or working with private/public key infrastructure
- `fs`: provides utilities for interacting with the **file system**; how we create, read, update, and delete files from the computer
- `http`: used to create and handle HTTP requests and responses

> You can learn more about the different built-in modules in the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/)

<br>

<br>

### HTTP and RESTful APIs in more depth

Throughout the course, we've been working with API data and services from third parties like JSON Placeholder, `openweathermap.org`, and GitHub.

To do so, we've been leveraging the same request and response model used behind-the-scenes by browsers to fetch HTML, submit form data, and download files.

As we've seen before when working with `fetch` and `axios`, we can use JavaScript to leverage the same communication protocol used by the browser itself (called HTTP, or **H**yper **T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) to interact with API services that understand HTTP requests.

While HTTP is not the only way to interact with external services, it is by far the most common because of the browser's native support.

Now that we're building our own APIs to handle HTTP requests, let's take a closer look at what goes into an HTTP request and response.

<br>

---

## HTTP Servers

While working with file systems is very useful, Node's event-driven model and penchant for asynchronous programming mean that it really shines when used to serve content to thousands of requests at a time.

We often refer to the computers that listen to such requests "**servers**", and you'll often hear Node referred to as a _"server-side" JavaScript runtime_.

Because these hardware servers are rarely running anything other than a collection of applications to handle requests, those _applications_ are _also_ often called "_servers_" themselves.

The most common way for web applications (like the ones we've been building so far) to make requests of servers is through **HTTP**.

In our practice SPA, let's build our own application (or "service" or "server") to serve up content for web applications!


<br>

---

<br>

## Building an HTTP Server with Node

To get started, Here is the simplest possible `http` server.   We need to create a `server` folder and `app.js` file to store our HTTP server.

Let's do so by creating a new folder named `server` at the root of our project and touching the `app.js` file within the "server" folder

```javascript
// 'Import' the http module
const http = require("http");
// Initialize the http server
const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    // Handle the request from http://localhost:4040/status with HTTP GET method
    if (request.url === "/status" && request.method === "GET") {
      // Create the headers for response
      response.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
      // Create the response body
      response.write(JSON.stringify({ message: "Service healthy" }));
      // End and return the response
      response.end();
    }
  })
  // Tell the HTTP server to start listening
  .listen(4040);

// Let the humans know I am running and listening on 4040
console.log("Listening on port 4040");
```

<br>

We require http from base node packages and create an instance of the server.   This now allows us to configure any requests that the server receives.

This is done via an if conditional that checks for a given route ("/status") and a specific method ("GET").
If the request matches the route and method it is handled by creating a response.
We need to write the status code and content-type headers so that the browser knows what to expect in response.
We then need to populate the response body with a stringified JSON message.
Then finally to send the response back to the browser we need to end the response.

At this point we have a server but it is not listening for any requests so we need to tell it to listen.

<br>

#### Testing Our Server

To run our server, we run the file just like any other JS file with `node <path or filename>`.

Unfortunately, every time we alter our file, we must stop the server with Ctrl+C and restart it with the same `node` command.

Luckily we will learn a better way to run and restart our server in the next lesson.

<br>

Look at some GUI-based tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the API server instead of the SPA as there may be bugs in the SPA that are harder to identify.

On the command line, take a look at `curl` or [`httpie`](https://httpie.org/).

> We recommend Insomnia for its ease of use, and ability to do what we need in a simple manner.

<br>

---

<br>

## Monitor and restart your server with `nodemon`

As we start to make more changes to our server, it becomes increasingly cumbersome to remember to interrupt the running server process and restart the `node` command with every change.

We can automate that process of _watching_ source files for changes and _restarting_ the running process.

We can do so with an npm package called [**`nodemon`**](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#nodemon).

<br>

Let's set-up `nodemon` in our practice SPA:

1. Install `nodemon` as a `devDependency` with `npm install -D nodemon`
   a. The `-D` option in the shortcut for `--save-dev`
2. Add a new `script` to `package.json`:

   ```json
   "server:watch": "nodemon --watch ./server -e js ./server/app.js"
   ```

   > **NOTE**: This serve script watches `./server/app.js`, where we will build our API server in the next lesson.

<br>

3. Now, instead of running `node ./server/app.js` in the terminal (and manually stopping and restarting our server), we can run `npm run app:watch`, and our server will automatically restart after every file change!

<br>

<br>

## HTTP Methods

By this point, we should be familiar with some aspects of GET and POST requests. But there are more HTTP verbs to explore! Let's take a look at some of these methods and how we might see them used in the wild.

<br>

When talking about HTTP methods, we further group those methods into **"safe"** methods and **"idempotent"** methods.

- **"Safe" methods** should not alter data. Generally speaking, `GET` is the only truly safe method.
- **["Idempotent"](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+say+idempotent) methods** should result in the same resource state no matter how many times the same request is made. IE. multiple identical requests will have the exact same outcomes. All of the methods except the `POST` and `PATCH` methods, should strive for idempotentcy.

<br>

| HTTP Method | Use-case                                      | Request Body \* | Response Body \* | Safe | Idempotent |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| **GET**     | Reading resources                             | empty          | not empty       | yes  | yes        |
| **POST**    | Often (but not always) creating new resources | not empty      | not empty       | no   | no         |
| **PUT**     | Creating or updating a specific resource      | not empty      | not empty       | no   | yes        |
| **PATCH**   | Updating a specific resource                  | not empty      | not empty       | no   | no \*\*     |
| **DELETE**  | Deleting a specific resource                  | empty          | not empty       | no   | yes        |

---

<br>

> \* Request and response bodies often follow these conventions, but there are a number of variations between implementations since adherence to these guidelines is entirely up to API authors. Some common variations might include `POST` or `PATCH` updates that only return a status code instead of returning a body that contains the new or edited resource, or `DELETE` requests that use a request body to identify the resource being deleted instead of using a URL.

<br>

> \*\* While PATCH requests are not _required_ to be idempotent, it's usually a good idea to make sure that your PATCH requests are idempotent anyway. There are some use-cases where a single PATCH depends on the current state of a resource, but it's often better to handle the calculation of that new state on the client instead of in the server.

<br>

This is not an exhaustive list of HTTP methods, but these are the ones you'll encounter most often, and the methods that map most cleanly to the "CRUD" operations we've seen so far in the course.

You can see an [exhaustive list of HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) in the Mozilla documentation

## API servers (REST)

<br>

### REST Principles

In previous lessons or in documentation that you've seen while exploring on your own, you'll probably have heard APIs described as "ReSTful".

Unlike HTTP, [REST](https://restfulapi.net/) (or [**Re**epresentational **S**tate **T**ransfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)) is not a protocol or specification; rather, _REST is an architectural pattern_.

It is not the only way to build APIs, nor is it necessarily coupled to HTTP as a means of transferring state responsively, but we'll find that the principles of a ReSTful architecture map intuitively to the HTTP protocol that we've been using thus far. And we will find that the API we just built is, in fact, a ReSTful API!

<br>

**ReSTful applications are built around 5 core values:**

1. Client-Server Separation
2. Statelessness
3. Cacheable Resources
4. Uniform Interface
5. Layered Architecture

<br>

> Note that nowhere do these values mention specific protocols like HTTP, or data formats like JSON. But let's look at why it's so common to find ReSTful APIs that use HTTP to expose data as JSON:

<br>

### **Client-Server Separation, Statelessness, and Cacheable Resources**

These requirements are met simply by using HTTP.

- As we've already discovered, HTTP forces servers to handle generic requests that might come from any number of clients, which also enforces a general **client-server separation**.
- Additionally, HTTP requests and responses can only contain headers and bodies; all state must be included in one of those places, in every request and every response, which satisfies the **statelessness requests**.
- And finally, the consistent format of HTTP requests means that **any request or response could be stored (or "cached")** without requiring a persistent connection to the underlying HTTP service.

<br>

### **Uniform Resources**

We've intuitively stumbled upon this principle in our existing API by leveraging HTTP methods:

Once you know that you can interact somehow with a "user" resource, then you can surmise that ...

- `GET /pizzas` would get you the entire collection of pizzas,
- `GET /pizzas/:id` would get you a single pizza,
- `POST /pizzas` would create a new pizza,
- `PATCH /pizzas/:id` would edit a pizza if it exists,
- `DELETE /pizzas/:id` would delete a pizza if it exists, and
- `PUT /pizzas/:id` would create a new pizza with a specific `id` if it didn't already exist a.k.a. "upsert", and update that pizza if it existed before.

You can apply that same logic to any resource that we might want to create in the future, from "author" to "reader" and so on and so forth.

That consistent pattern of accessing resources through a Unique Resource Identifier (or URI, also known as a URL) gives ReSTful APIs a discoverability missing from APIs designed without such constraints.

<br>

### **Layered Architecture**

And finally, we've found that the use of **HTTP + JSON + Node + a format-agnostic data store**, has given us an architecture that can be interchange-able at the interfaces:

- We could exchange our MongoDb database for FireStore or PostgreSQL at any time, and the user consuming JSON from our API would never know. (You could read more about Google FireStore or PostgreSQL in the [Curriculum Addendum Section](../AddendumOfResources/AddendumOfResources.md))
- We could switch from Node to Deno, or from Python to Ruby, or to a compiled Go or Rust binary and, **as long as the HTTP service contract was maintained**, the user would never know.

<br>

### So, since our API meets all of the above specifications, congratulate yourself! You've now written your first RESTful API!
