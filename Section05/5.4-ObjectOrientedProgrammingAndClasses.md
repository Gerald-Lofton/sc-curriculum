## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Organizing code structures around _Objects_ rather than _functions_ is called **O**bject-**O**riented **P**rogramming (**OOP**).

As we've seen already, Objects can have "keys" which are Strings, and "values" which can be any data type: Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Objects... even functions!

```javascript
//  example of a complex object:
const person = {
  name: "Pat",
  location: "St. Louis",
  age: 33,
  hobbies: ["working", "partying", "sleeping"],
  pets: [
    {
      type: "dog",
      name: "Jack",
      age: 10,
      breed: "Pit mix",
      rescue: true,
      goodBoy: true,
      bark: function bigBark() {
        return "Ruff";
      },
    },
    {
      type: "dog",
      name: "Gilbert",
      age: 2,
      breed: "Mini Aussie",
      rescue: true,
      goodBoy: true,
      bark: function littleBark() {
        return "Yap, yap, yap";
      },
    },
  ],
  party: function throwParty() {
    return "Dance, dance, dance!";
  },
};
```

## Methods and the `this` keyword in Javascript OOP

In the example above, `party` and `bark` are `functions`.
If a `function` is attached to an _Object_, we refer to that `function` as a **method**.

While it is perfectly valid to declare the `party` method as we did above, we can also use a shorter syntax:

```javascript
const person = {
  // other properties here
  party() {
    return "Dance, dance, dance!";
  },
};
```

We can call this method by invoking `person.party()`.

But what do methods give us besides a bit of organizational and semantic clarity?

One of the big benefits of attaching methods to Objects is access to the _calling context_ (or parent Object) of that method through the **"`this`"** keyword.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Pat",
  // other properties and methods
  greet() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}`;
  },
};
```

`this` is a tough concept in JavaScript, but the thing to remember is that `this` refers to the _calling context_ - or parent Object - of a `function`. In the example above `this` refers the the Object `person`.

What if a function was in the _global context_ and accessed `this`?
Try declaring this regular `function` in the global scope:

```javascript
function logDefaultContext() {
  console.log("this is: ", this);
}
```

In the example above, `this` references the global `window` Object in the browser, or the `global` Object in Node.

### Activity 1: Create an object and use `this`

## Creating Objects with `function` Constructors

<br>

Object literals are fine as long as we're dealing with a single object/thing.
Often, however, it is more useful to create a **category** of objects/things in order to _share properties and methods_ among Objects of the same type.

A **`function` Constructors** is used as a kind of "_template_" for creating a _category_ of things instead of, creating just a specific single _instance_ of a thing (like with an Object literal).

- `function` constructors are conventionally _capitalized_ to help them stand apart from "regular" functions.
- Like any other function, just _declaring_ the `function` constructor doesn't actually call or invoke the function.
- But, _unlike_ other functions, to invoke a `function` constructor we must use the `new` keyword.

```javascript
// declaring the function constructor
function Person(name, age, interests) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.interests = interests;
  this.bio = `${this.name} is ${
    this.age
  } years old. They like ${this.interests.join(", ")}`;
  this.greet = function () {
    return `Hello! I'm ${this.name}`;
  };
}

// using the `NEW` keyword to create an instance of the object `Person`
const pat = new Person("Pat", 35, ["movies", "cats"]);
const mack = new Person("Mack", 31, ["music", "baseball", "TV"]);
```

<br>

### **The `Object.prototype`**

<br>

If we `log` `pat` and `mack`from above, we see that they _share properties_, but have _different values_ for those shared properties.
We **also** see that they _share methods_, but that those methods are _exactly the same function_ for each instance.

It is _unnecessary and wasteful_ for each instance of Person to "carry around" the same set of methods. It is more idiomatic for each instance to **inherit** (share) its methods from a **prototype**.

To set a property / method on a prototype, simply chain `.prototype` on the end of your `function` constructor.
With our `Person` constructor above, we should have attached our methods using the `.prototype` keyword like this:

```javascript
Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `Hello! I'm ${this.name}`;
};
```

Declaring methods this way frees your instances from having to "carry around" its methods.

But what is `prototype` and why can it "carry" properties/methods for instances/Objects?

<br>

### **Inheritance**

<br>

To understand inheritance one should think of family genetics. Parents have traits that are passed on to their children. In addition, a parent controls the environment that the children operate in.

A Javascript Class can therefore be thought of as a parent. The children inherit information from the parent class.

As anyone with siblings (or children) can attest, not all of the child objects behave the same.
This is where the idea of **prototype** comes in.
The method that a child inherits can be altered using `prototype`. Or, if need be, an entirely new method can even be added.

Each object has a _private property_(`__proto__`) which holds a link to another object called its **prototype**.
That prototype object _has a prototype of its own_, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.
By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this **prototype chain**.

When trying to access a property/method of an Object, JavaScript will **first** check for that property on the Object itself.
However, if it fails to find the property, it **then** checks for the property on the Object's _prototype_. Then checks on _that prototype's prototype_, _and so on..._ until it finds the property it's looking for, or reaches the _end_ of the prototype chain.

To learn more about inheritance and `prototype`, explore the [MDN Documentation on Inheritance and the prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

<br>

### **"Overwriting" `prototype` Properties**

<br>

Because JS checks the _Object itself_ for a property **before** checking the `prototype`, we can "overwrite" a `prototype` property / method _for that particular instance_ by declaring it on the instance directly.

> **NOTE**: We are not _actually_ overwriting the `prototype` property. When JS starts searching for the property on the Object, it finds that property name on the Object itself, so it never checks the `prototype`. We could think of it as a kind of "short-circuiting" the `prototype` property.

```javascript
Person.prototype.dance = function () {
  return "Dance, dance, dance";
};
pat.dance(); // returns "Dance, dance, dance"
mack.dance(); // returns "Dance, dance, dance"

// this "overwrites" the dance method for Pat
pat.dance = function noFun() {
  return "I don't dance.";
};
pat.dance(); // returns "I don't dance"
mack.dance(); // returns "Dance, dance, dance"
```

### Activity 2: `function` constructors

# Classes & Objects

A little bit of theory:
Objects are a representation of real world objects like cars, dogs, or bikes. The objects share two main characteristics: data and behavior.

Cars have data, like number of wheels, number of doors, and seating capacity They also exhibit behavior: they can accelerate, stop, show how much fuel is left, and so many other things.

We identify data as attributes and behavior as methods in object-oriented programming. Again:

> **Data → Attributes and Behavior → Methods**

And a Class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In the real world, we often find many objects with the same type. Like cars. All the same make and model (and all have an engine, wheels, doors, and so on). Each car was built from the same set of blueprints and has the same components.

<br>

## Creating Javascript Objects with the `class` Keyword

<br>

For decades, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript was built around `function` constructors and direct `prototype` modification -- as we explored above.
This worked, but was very cumbersome to write and maintain when compared to other programming languages.

To make OOP a bit easier for web developers, JavaScript now has a **`class` keyword** that allows us to re-write our `function` constructors and `prototype` methods, **\*\*combining them in the same scope/"package"\*\***.

**A class is a template for creating objects**. Inside the object that you create, code is written that allows you to work with the object data.
This code is written inside curly brackets and is known as the body of the class.

```javascript
// "class" syntax
class CategoryName {
  // Body of the Class goes inside the class scope...
  method1() {}
}
```

### **Declare a Class**

To declare a class, simply use the `class` keyword and the class name followed by some braces ( `{}` ) that define the _scope_ of the `class`.

<br>

### **The `constructor()` function**

The _first_ thing inside the class's scope will be a **`constructor()` function** that effectively takes the place of our `function` constructors.
Like `function` constructors, the `constructor()` function takes a number of arguments that will be used to populate the properties of the Object using the `this` keyword.

```javascript
// "class" syntax
class CategoryName {
  //  Constructor function inside class scope uses "this"
  constructor(param1, param2) {
    this.property1 = param1;
    this.property2 = param2;
  }
  // The Class methods follow
  method1() {}
}
```

<br>

### **The function methods**

_After_ the `constructor()` function, we declare any and all **methods** that we want to attach to the class's `prototype` Object.

To create an **instance** of the `class`, use the `new` keyword and the class name, exactly like `function` constructors.

```javascript
// using the class keyword to declare a class/category
class Person {
  // the constructor function looks and acts similar to the function constructors we have been working with
  constructor(name, age, interests) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.interests = interests;
    this.bio = `${this.name} is ${
      this.age
    } years old. They like ${this.interests.join(", ")}`;
  }
  // properties/methods outside of the scope of the constructor function attach to the Person prototype
  greet() {
    return `Hello! I'm ${this.name}`;
  }
  dance() {
    return "Dance, dance, dance";
  }
  // end of Person scope
}

// creating new instances of the Person class
const pat = new Person("Pat", 35, ["movies", "cats"]);
const mack = new Person("Mack", 31, ["music", "baseball", "TV"]);
```

<br>

### **Inheriting Behavior with the `extend` Keyword**

<br>

A major benefit of the `class` keyword is the ability to **`extend`** a class, _adding to the `prototype` chain_ and allowing new classes to _inherit behavior from classes_ they `extend`.

```javascript
// "extends" syntax uses the super() method
class SpecificCategory extends CategoryName {
  constructor(param1, param2, param3) {
    super(param1, param2);
    this.property3 = param3;
  }
  method2() {}
}
```

To declare an **`class` extension**, use the `class` keyword and the class name followed by the `extends` keyword and the class you want to extend. Again, curly braces ( `{}` ) define the _scope_ of the `class`.

```javascript
class SpecificCategory extends CategoryName {}
```

- The _first_ thing inside the class's scope will be a _`constructor()` function_ that effectively takes the place of our `function` constructors.
- The **first** thing _inside the `constructor()` function_ will be a **`super()` function** that calls the _`constructor()` function_ of it's _parent/extended class_.
  - We pass the "general"/shared parameters that are not specific to the `class` extension into the `super()` function.
- After the general parameters, _new parameters, specific to this class extension_, are declared.
- _After_ the `constructor()` function, we declare any and all **methods** that we want to attach to the class's `prototype` Object.

To create an **instance** of the `class` extension, use the `new` keyword and the class name, exactly like with `function` constructors and `class`.

```javascript
// using the extends keyword to declare a class/category that extends the prototype chain of Person
class Teacher extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, interests, subject) {
    // the super function calls the constructor function from its parent class (Person)
    super(name, age, interests);
    this.subject = subject;
  }
  // this greet method "overwrites" Person's greet method
  greet() {
    return `Hello! I'm ${this.name}, and I teach ${this.subject}`;
  }
}

// creating a new instance of the Teacher class
const jo = new Teacher("Jo", 61, ["art", "camels", "boats"], "art");

jo.greet(); // returns "Hello! I'm Jo, and I teach art"
jo.bio; // returns "Jo is 61 years old. They like art, camels, boats"
```
