## Relationships in Document Store Databases

Relationships are defined several ways in a NoSQL or Document database.

There are 3 basic relationship types in all databases include **one-to-one**, **one-to-many** and **many-to-many**.
Traditionally in relational databases these relationships are all identified/linked via a foreign key in both tables that represent the data being modeled.

In a Document Store database there are two different possible definition styles that can be used to define these same relationships: **Embedded documents**; and **References** which is similar to the foreign key method from relational database.

## Create an Orders router and necessary models

Let's create a Orders route that allows us to store an order with customer, pizza, delivery and notes information.

<br>

### **Create the models needed for the orders router**

<br>

1. ### Create the `customer.js` file for the customer model within the `models` folder

```node
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const customerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  address: String,
  city: String,
  state: String,
  postalCode: String
});

const Customer = mongoose.model("Customer", customerSchema);

module.exports = {
  model: Customer,
  schema: customerSchema
};
```

<br>

2. ### Create the `delivery.js` file for the customer model within the `models` folder

```node
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const deliverySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  time: String,
  driver: String
});

const Delivery = mongoose.model("Delivery", deliverySchema);

module.exports = {
  model: Delivery,
  schema: deliverySchema
};
```

<br>

3. ### Create the `note.js` file for the customer model within the `models` folder

```node
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const noteSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  timestamp: String, // Could be Date as well, but used String to reduce complexity, not recommended
  note: String
});

const Note = mongoose.model("Note", noteSchema);

module.exports = {
  model: Note,
  schema: noteSchema
};
```

> The `customer`, `delivery` and `note` models are straight forward with standard attributes and no sub-documents.

<br>

4. ### Create the `order.js` file for the customer model within the `models` folder

```node
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const delivery = require("./delivery");
const note = require("./note");

// Demonstrate linking vs embedding
const orderSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  pizzas: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Pizza" }],
  customer: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Customer" },
  delivery: delivery.schema,
  notes: [note.schema]
});

const Order = mongoose.model("Order", orderSchema);

module.exports = {
  model: Order,
  schema: orderSchema
};
```

- Take note that in the `order` model that there are "`requires`" for the **delivery** and **note** models. This allows us to reference them in the `order` model as sub-documents.

- We also have complex attribute types in the `order` model that allows us to identify the sub-documents for each order.

- The `pizzas` and `customer` attributes are references to sub-documents that are stored as separate documents. This is due to the fact that you may want to list customers and pizzas in other parts of the applications without having to reference an order.

```node
pizzas: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Pizza" }],
```

> For example, the `pizzas` attribute is an array of sub-document `_id`s that reference sub-documents with a model type of `Pizza`.
>
> The `delivery` and `notes` attributes are references to sub-documents that are stored as embedded documents. These documents cannot easily be referenced outside the `order` model.

<br>

<br>

### **Finally, create the orders router**

<br>

Finally let's create a router that allows us to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) orders and their related embedded and referenced documents.

<br>

#### **1. Create an order document**

<br>

First we need to create the `orders.js` file in the `routers` folder and add the following code.

```node
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const Order = require("../models/order");
const Customer = require("../models/customer");
const Pizza = require("../models/pizza");

// Create a new order with customer, pizza, delivery and notes documents
router.post("/", (request, response) => {
  const body = request.body;

  // Create the sub-documents
  const customer = new Customer.model(body.customer);
  customer.save();
  const pizzaIds = body.pizzas.map(pizza => {
    const newPizza = new Pizza.model(
      { ...pizza, order: newOrder._id }
    );
    newPizza.save();
    return newPizza._id;
  });

  // Create the order document
  const newOrder = new Order.model({
    pizzas: pizzaIds,
    customer: customer._id,
    notes: body.notes
  });

  newOrder.save((error, data) => {
    return error ? response.sendStatus(500).json(error) : response.json(data);
  });
});

// Retrieve a single order with the option to not populate the sub-documents
router.get("/:id", (request, response) => {

});


// Retrieve all orders with the option to not populate the sub-documents
router.get("/", (request, response) => {

});

// Update a single orders pizza, delivery and notes sub=documents
router.put("/:id", (request, response) => {

});

// Remove a single order and it's sub-documents
router.delete("/:id", (request, response) => {

});

module.exports = router;
```

The first route we will create allows us to create an order. **Take note that we must create and save the sub-documents before creating the order document**. Ideally this would be done in a transaction so if any of the multiple operations failed they would all be backed out.

<br>

#### **2. Read an order document from the document store**

<br>

Next let's add the HTTP `GET` method routes to read an individual order, and all orders and their sub-documents. This route allows us to read the document with or without the details of the sub-documents.

```node
router.get("/:id", (request, response) => {
  // Request parameters (params) are defined in the route, queryParams are provided after the url behind a ? and & in key=value pairs
  const params = request.params;
  const query = request.query;
  if (query.hasOwnProperty("raw") && query.raw === "true") {
    Order.model.findById(params.id, (error, data) => {
      return error ? response.sendStatus(500).json(error) : response.json(data);
    });
  } else {
    Order.model
      .findById(params.id)
      .populate("customer")
      .populate("pizzas")
      .exec((error, data) => {
        return error ? response.sendStatus(500).json(error) : response.json(data);
      });
  }
});

router.get("/", (request, response) => {
  const query = request.query;
  if (query.hasOwnProperty("raw") && query.raw === "true") {
    Order.model.find({}, (error, data) => {
      return error ? response.sendStatus(500).json(error) : response.json(data);
    });
  } else {
    Order.model
      .find({})
      .populate("customer")
      .populate("pizzas")
      .exec((error, data) => {
        return error ? response.sendStatus(500).json(error) : response.json(data);
      });
  }
});
```

By default we will populate the `customer` and `pizzas` sub-documents but if the `raw` query parameter is passed in and it is true, then we will only return the `_id` for each sub-document.

<br>

#### **3. Delete an order document**

<br>

Now that we can create and read our order(s) we may want to delete them, so let's develop that route as well.

```node
router.delete("/:id", (request, response) => {
  Order.model.findByIdAndDelete(request.params.id, {}, (error, data) => {
    if (error) response.sendStatus(500).json(error);

    Pizza.model
      .deleteMany()
      .where("_id")
      .in(data.pizzas)
      .exec(error => {
        if (error) return response.sendStatus(500).json(error);
      });

    Customer.model.findByIdAndRemove(data.customer, error => {
      if (error) return response.sendStatus(500).json(error);
    });

    return response.json(data);
  });
});
```

> Notice how we need to find the referenced sub-documents and remove them from the document store, as well as the order document, so that we do not orphan any documents in the database.

<br>

#### **4. Update an order document**

<br>

There also may be a need to update an order after it has been created.

```node
router.put("/:id", (request, response) => {
  const data = request.body;
  Order.model.findByIdAndUpdate(
    request.params.id,
    {
      $set: {
        delivery: data.delivery,
        notes: data.notes
      }
    },
    (error, data) => {
      data.pizzas.forEach(pizza => {
        Pizza.model.findByIdAndUpdate(
          pizza._id,
          {
            $setOnInsert: {
              crust: pizza.crust,
              cheese: pizza.cheese,
              sauce: pizza.sauce,
              toppings: pizza.toppings,
              order: pizza.order
            }
          },
          { upsert: true, new: true },
          error => {
            return response.sendStatus(500).json(error);
          }
        );
      });

      return error ? response.sendStatus(500).json(error) : res.json(data);
    }
  );
});
```

> This is by far the most complicated route. Notice that the 'customer' has been omitted from the update.
>
> As a bonus, think about how you might implement the customer update if time allows.
