## What are Single-Page Applications

A **SPA** (**S**ingle-**P**age **A**pplication) is a web development implementation that allows users to use websites without requesting and loading new pages from a server. SPAs can improve user experience with faster load times since whole websites can be used without any additional loading of pages.

SPAs also create for a separation of concerns allowing front-end developers to develop websites without server-side jobs and back-end developers to develop features without client-side jobs.

**S**earch **E**ngine **O**ptimization (**SEO**) is one potential disadvantage of SPAs. _Some_ SEO Web Crawlers cannot execute JavaScript and therefore cannot access the HTML inside SPAs functional components.

While we are learning SPAs in "_plain_"/vanilla JS, starting with vanilla JS now will make it easier in the future to learn any of the available JavaScript **frameworks** meant for SPAs. Here are a few of the most popular SPA frameworks:

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/)

<br>

> **NOTE**: Do **NOT** use these frameworks on your capstone, these are just what some of what's available after learning to build an SPA with vanilla JS.

## Comparing pre-SPA and SPA Websites

<br>

### **Pre-SPA Website**

When we built websites before, all we really "needed" were a few files: our `index.html`, a JavaScript file, and a CSS file.

![Basic Pre-SPA File Structure](img/basic-pre-SPA-file-structure.png)

When developing a website, we also needed `live-server` to **serve** our files locally.

In order to develop our site with more pages/views/content, we needed to add _more_ HTML or content. As we have seen, we can "offload" some HTML content onto JavaScript by using _DOM methods_ to create elements or add content to our page. However, with so few files, each file can grow quite **bloated** with increasingly complex content as our website grows...

After adding a few more pages to our website, our project folder might look something like this...

<br>

### **SPA Website**

SPAs, on the other hand, involve a great deal more files, yet each individual file contains a much more manageable amount of code.

While more files might sound just as hard to manage, additional files used for SPA are contained within one of three new folders: `components`, `store`, or `lib`.

![Basic SPA File Structure](img/basic-SPA-file-structure.png)

<br>

### **Essential File Structure of an SPA**

- **`components`** stands for "functional **components**." The `components` folder holds _JS modules_ which _export_ **functions** that populate the HTML document. Each functional component corresponds to a _section_ or page/_view_ of your website.
  - If your site has many "pages"/views, it is common to create a **`views` folder** inside `components` that contains the files for every view/"page".
- **`lib`** represents the an _optional_ **lib**rary of _JS modules_ which _export_ Functions, Classes, Objects, or Arrays that we might need in any of our "main" (`components`, `store`, `index.js`) JavaScript files.
- **`store`** represents the _storage_ of the current **state** of the _data_ that populates our site. **State** (or pieces of it) is _passed into_ the _functional components_, and the functional components use the data from state to populate the site. There is no single way to structure `store`, but generally, each piece of your site that you want to keep track of should have a module in `store`.
- **`index.html`** - the `body` of `index.html` will contain only a `div` with an `id` of `root` (`<div id="root"></div>`) and a `script` tag that links to our `index.js`
- **`index.js`** - the root-level `index.js` file contains the `render()` function that targets the `root` `div`, then calls our functional components to _render_ our site. This `index.js` file also contains our _event listeners_, since we can only target the elements to listen for events after they have been rendered.
- **`style.css`** - _No change_ from pre-SPA web development. We still need only one stylesheet, and all the same selectors and rules apply.

<br>

### **The importance of having index files**

In the Pre-SPA file structure you had an index.html, index.js, and a style.css file. In the SPA file structure you should notice that these same three files are present, along with some folders.

#### **index.html**

The root (base level) index.html can be thought of as your homepage. This is a page that a user will access by default. When a user attempts to access a website and no path extension is given, the web server will look for the default page. Take for example the capstone project [Find A Trail](https://findatrail.netlify.app/). Since the address given is `findatrail.netlify.app` you are looking at the default page. If you specify a different path, `findatrail.netlify.app/Pitt` for example, the web server knows exactly what page to look for.

As you build out your SPA you will have separate files for each view (or page that you want to look at). The web server is able to understand the path to access each of these views because of the information that is located in the `index.html` file.

#### **index.js**

As you know, any JavaScript file gives a website functionality. The `index.js` file sets itself apart in what it gives functionality to. In the previously mentioned root `index.html`, there is a script tag in the body for the `index.js`. The reason for this is that the root `index.js` gives functionality for the entire web application that you create.

![Basic SPA File Structure](img/basic-SPA-file-structure.png)

In the SPA file structure,you notice that there are also folders. Each of these folders contain files that will operate on their own (not as part of your SPA) until told otherwise. This is the reason for needing an `index.js` file inside each of these folders. The `index.js` file inside each folder aggregates the files in the folder and makes them functional parts of your web application.

### **Serving an SPA: Bundlers/`Parcel`**

`live-server` cannot serve JavaScript modules. You may see an error that says `"import statement cannot be used outside a module"` if you attempt to serve an SPA with a "regular" server simulator like `live-server`.

Instead, we need to use a **bundler** to _build_ our SPA. The bundler we will use is called [**Parcel**](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel#readme). Parcel "connects"/compiles all of our files and dependencies into a smaller set of output files that can be used to run our code.

<br>

**To add Parcel to your project:**

1. In your terminal, and in your repo, enter `npm install -d parcel-bundler` to install `parcel` as a development dependency.

```json
// in package.json
"devDependencies": {
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.4",
    ...
```

2. Since Parcel is taking the place of `live-server`, we can remove that line from our `devDependencies` (if we didn't install it globally). And since we removed `live-server`, we need a new way to serve our page. In the `scripts` section of `package.json`, we add the following commands: `parcel-build` and `serve`.

```json
// in package.json
...
"scripts": {
    "parcel-build": "parcel build index.html && cp _redirects ./dist/",
    "serve": "parcel index.html"
  },
...
```

Now, when we enter `npm run serve` into our terminal when inside our project folder, `parcel` serves up our website instead of `live-server`. Entering `npm run parcel-build` "bundles" our files into a smaller set of files inside of a new folder: `dist`.

We need the second part of `parcel-build` ( "`cp _redirects ./dist/`" ) to handle our our SPA navigation - we want any and all "routes" (web.site/_**route**_) to just render `index.html` since our SPA is only a single page. This part of the command tells `parcel` to **c**opy and **p**aste a file named `_redirects` into the `dist` directory it is creating. However, we don't have a `_redirects` file yet. Let's make one.

3. In the root directory of your project, `touch`/create a file named `_redirects` (notice the lack of `.` extension).
4. Inside `_redirects`, add this single line of code: `/* /index.html 200`. This tells `parcel` to _redirect_ **any route** ("`/*`") to `index.html`.
5. Now when we run your `parcel-build` script, we shouldn't get any errors.

## M-V-U Architecture

**Model-View-Update** architecture is based on the [MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) with a main difference being that MVU architecture maintains _unidirectional_ (one-way) data flow.

- **Model** (_state_) - the current state of the application's data.
- **View** (_components/views_) - the functional components that hold the HTML for displaying the site.
- **Update** (_event listeners_) - event listeners that handle user input and use it to alter the _state_/model.

So, our **model** is passed into and rendered by our **view** which then listens for user input that **updates** the _model_, which is then passed into and rendered by our _view_ which then listens for user input that _updates_ our model, which is then passed into... etc.

## Activity (instructor): Stateless and State-driven SPAs

The instructor will walk though how to convert a "static" pre-SPA website (in this lesson's Activities folder) into, first, a [stateless SPA site](https://github.com/savvy-coders/Stateless-SPA-example), then, a [state-driven SPA site](https://github.com/savvy-coders/State-Driven-SPA-example).

Just follow along for now, we will be diving into each important concept over the next few classes.

What we will end up with is first, a stateless SPA with a folder structure that could look something like this here below...
