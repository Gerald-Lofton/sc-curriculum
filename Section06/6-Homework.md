## Homework is due to your TA by next Monday before class

- In your capstone repo create the folder structure for an SPA -- `components`, `views`, and `store`.
- Add files for components that would be repeated on each page/view of your capstone -- `Header`, `Nav`, `Main`, and `Footer`
- Add a file for each page in your capstone in `views` and `store`
- Remember to build your aggregators (`index.js`) in `components`, `views`, and `store`

Below is an example of what the file structure could possibly look like (Ignore anything that was not covered in class. This is **_only an example_** so don't freak out or loose your feable little minds!):
