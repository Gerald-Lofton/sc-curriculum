### Essential Dev Tools

| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CLI (Command Line Interface)  | In a command line interface (A.K.A. "Console", "Command Line", "Terminal", or "Shell"), the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action. The computer will display the results of the operation by writing text to the screen.      |
| CLI Commands   | See [Section 1.5-GitandGitHub](https://github.com/savvy-coders/sc-curriculum/blob/master/Section01/1.5-GitandGitHub.md) in curriculum.       |
| GIT (Global Information Tracker)   | A mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.        |
| Github   | A cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.     |
| git Commands   | See [Section 1.5-GitandGitHub](https://github.com/savvy-coders/sc-curriculum/blob/master/Section01/1.5-GitandGitHub.md) in curriculum.       |
| npm (Node Package Manager)   | Node Package Manager (npm) is our dependency-management system.      |
| VS Code   | A modular editor built for web development, maintained by Microsoft, and contributed to by a large Open Source community.    |
| Chrome Dev Tools    | We can use Chrome's Dev Tools to play around with JS in our browser. Open those tools up with either "Ctrl + Shift + I" on Windows or "Cmd + Option + I" on Mac.       |

### Languages

| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| JavaScript   | JavaScript (JS) is the most applicable, powerful and flexible language in the world today - no other language in the world allows us to work natively in the browser (client side) while also on the server (NodeJS) while also creating super-fast web-based applications (Single Page Applications - SPAs - Angular or React or Vue) while also using the same code to create native desktop applications (Electron) while also creating native mobile apps (React Native or NativeScript)!    |
| HTML   | Text        |
| CSS   | Text        |
| Markdown   | A simple markup language for formatting text.     |

### Functions

| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Function   | Broad Use: We use functions to 'wrap up' some code and give it a name so that we can just invoke it 'upon demand.' This means less repetitive code. In JS, we should consider "function" to take the broader meaning of another related term: "procedure". A procedure is a collection of statements that can be invoked one or more times, may be provided some inputs, and may give back one or more outputs.         |
| Function Declaration   | JS functions start with the function keyword, followed by parentheses for the function's arguments or parameters, followed by braces that define the function's scope (the code that will run when the function is called or invoked). This can be done with either function expressions or function declarations.     |
| Function Invocation   | To invoke a function, use the parentheses after the name of the stored function (e.g. myFirstFunction()). This runs that code inside of the curly braces.         |
| Function Return   | The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller. If we don't include an explicit return, then function returns undefined.        |
| JS Parameters   | Named parameters give our inputs (arguments) variable names while the function is running. We use a named parameter for each of the arguments that we expect to receive.        |
| JS Rest Parameter(...)   | The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. A function's last parameter can be prefixed with ... which will cause all remaining (user supplied) arguments to be placed within an array. Only the last parameter can be a "rest parameter".       |
| Scope   | Scope is the current context of execution. The context in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or other expression is not "in the current scope," then it is unavailable for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.       |
| Composing Functions   | Composing functions occurs when we use the return value of a function as an argument for another function.        |
| Modularity   | Modular code is written in such a way that each piece of functionality is separated into a function and then composed in various ways to extend an app's features and functionality (extensibility).        |
| Callback Functions   | A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.        |
| Arrow Syntax   | An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without access to some keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.       |
