### Essential Dev Tools

| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CLI (Command Line Interface)  | In a command line interface (A.K.A. "Console", "Command Line", "Terminal", or "Shell"), the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action. The computer will display the results of the operation by writing text to the screen.      |
| CLI Commands   | See [Section 1.5-GitandGitHub](https://github.com/savvy-coders/sc-curriculum/blob/master/Section01/1.5-GitandGitHub.md) in curriculum.       |

### Languages

| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| JavaScript   | JavaScript (JS) is the most applicable, powerful and flexible language in the world today - no other language in the world allows us to work natively in the browser (client side) while also on the server (NodeJS) while also creating super-fast web-based applications (Single Page Applications - SPAs - Angular or React or Vue) while also using the same code to create native desktop applications (Electron) while also creating native mobile apps (React Native or NativeScript)!    |
| HTML   | A markup language for describing the structure and content of web documents/pages.        |
| CSS   | CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.       |

### Functions

| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Function   | Broad Use: We use functions to 'wrap up' some code and give it a name so that we can just invoke it 'upon demand.' This means less repetitive code. In JS, we should consider "function" to take the broader meaning of another related term: "procedure". A procedure is a collection of statements that can be invoked one or more times, may be provided some inputs, and may give back one or more outputs.         |
| Function Declaration   | JS functions start with the function keyword, followed by parentheses for the function's arguments or parameters, followed by braces that define the function's scope (the code that will run when the function is called or invoked). This can be done with either function expressions or function declarations.     |
| Function Invocation   | To invoke a function, use the parentheses after the name of the stored function (e.g. myFirstFunction()). This runs that code inside of the curly braces.         |
| Function Return   | The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller. If we don't include an explicit return, then function returns undefined.        |
| JS Parameters   | Named parameters give our inputs (arguments) variable names while the function is running. We use a named parameter for each of the arguments that we expect to receive.        |
| JS Rest Parameter(...)   | The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. A function's last parameter can be prefixed with ... which will cause all remaining (user supplied) arguments to be placed within an array. Only the last parameter can be a "rest parameter".       |
| Scope   | Scope is the current context of execution. The context in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or other expression is not "in the current scope," then it is unavailable for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.       |
| Composing Functions   | Composing functions occurs when we use the return value of a function as an argument for another function.        |
| Modularity   | Modular code is written in such a way that each piece of functionality is separated into a function and then composed in various ways to extend an app's features and functionality (extensibility).        |
| Callback Functions   | A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.        |
| Arrow Syntax   | An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without access to some keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.       |

### String & Array Methods

| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| String Methods   | JavaScript has a range of methods for doing String manipulation operations, such as `.toUpperCase()` and `.indexOf`. To review other string methods and to see examples, click here: [String Methods](../../Section04/4.2-ArrayMethods1.md#useful-string-methods)        |
| Array Properties   | Helps to use collections of data more effectively, such as `.length`.        |
| Array Methods   | Helps to use collections of data more effectively, such as `.push()`.        |
| Examples of Basic Array Methods  | To see examples and review syntax of Array Methods like `.push()`, click here: [Basic Array Methods](../../Section04/4.2-ArrayMethods1.md#adding-an-item-with-push-and-unshift)        |
| Examples of Complex Array Methods   | To see examples and review syntax of Array Methods like `.forEach()` and `.map()`, click here: [Complex Array Methods](../../Section04/4.3-ArrayMethods2.md#more-array-methods)        |

### JS and the DOM(Document Object Model)

| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| DOM (Document Object Model)   | Connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document. An example is the HTML representing a web page â€” in memory.        |
| DOM Methods   | To begin interacting with the HTML document, we first need to select some piece of the DOM. We can find elements by their HTML tag name, class name, or ID. To review, click here: [Selecting HTML Elements](../../Section04/4.1-DocumentObjectModel.md#dom-methods)      |
| DOM Tree   | The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.        |
| Node Tree   |  The nodes in the node tree have a hierarchical relationship to each other, and the terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships. In a node tree, the top node is called the root node. Every node has exactly one parent, except the root (which has no parent). A node can have a number of children. Siblings are nodes with the same parent.       |
| Example of DOM Tree     | [DOM Tree Example](../../Section04/4.1-DocumentObjectModel.md#dom-tree-example)        |
| Accessing Elements via Node Relationships   | `.children`, `.firstElementChild`, `.lastElementChild`, `.nextElementSibling`, `.parentElement` are node properties used to navigate between nodes.        |
| Node Properties   | To review which node properties are used to access different pieces of the element node, such as `.outerHTML` and `.innerHTML`, click here: [Node Properties](../../Section04/4.1-DocumentObjectModel.md#changing-html-elements)        |
| Adding & Removing Elements   | To add a new HTML element to the DOM, you must first create the new element before appending it. Use the following DOM methods to add or remove elements: `.createElement()`, `.appendChild()`, `.removeChild(child)`, `.remove()`. To review examples, click here: [Adding/Removing Elements](../../Section04/4.1-DocumentObjectModel.md#adding--removing-elements)           |
| Events & Event Handling   | Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.        |
| Common Events   | `click` and `dblclick`, `mousedown` and `mouseup`, `mouseover` and `mouseout`, `focus` and `blur`, `keydown` and `keyup` and `keypress`       |
| Event Listeners   | "Handlers", to review syntax and see and example of `.addEventListener()`, click here: [Event Listeners](../../Section04/4.1-DocumentObjectModel.md#addingremoving-event-listeners)        |

## HTML/CSS

### Basics of HTML and CSS

| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| "Text Content"   | The 'text content' is what we see on the page, and the tags describe or 'mark up' that text to give it structure.        |
| Tags   | HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets: `<html>`, HTML tags normally come in pairs like: `<p>` and `</p>` with the first tag in a pair being the start tag while the second tag is the end tag.        |
| HTML Tags and Attributes  | View Examples of Tags and Attributes here: [Tags and Attributes Examples](../../Section03/3.3-HTMLAndCSSBasics.md#html-boilerplate)     |
| class and id attributes   | `class` and `id` are two global attributes that can be attached to any element in order to select and access specific elements. You can create as many classes and IDs as you need, and you can use each class as many times as you need, but each ID should only be used once.        |
| `<div>` and `<span>` section tags   | The `<div>` element is a generic **block** element which defines a section of your page. The `<span>` element is a generic **inline** element which defines a section of your page.       |
| Three ways to give HTML Content Some Style   | inline styles, style tags, stylesheets       |
| Basic CSS Selectors   | `*`, `elementName`, `.className`, `#idName`. To review syntax, click here: [General CSS Syntax](../../Section03/3.3-HTMLAndCSSBasics.md#general-css-syntax)        |
| Complex CSS selectors   | As our documents grow, we'll need to leverage more complex CSS selection syntax. To review, click here: [Complex CSS selectors](../../Section03/3.3-HTMLAndCSSBasics.md#complex-css-selectors)        |
| Pseudo-class and Pseudo-elements   | There are some selectors that can be used to make some very basic calculations about the state of your markup, and add styles accordingly. To review: click here: [Pseudo-class and Pseudo-elements](../../Section03/3.3-HTMLAndCSSBasics.md#pseudo-classes-and-pseudo-elements)        |
