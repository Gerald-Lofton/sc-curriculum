## WHY TESTING

A test is a procedure that exercises a behavior to determine if the behavior functions correctly.

There are several different kinds of tests, like **unit tests**, **integration tests**, or **end-to-end tests**, but all functional tests do the same basic thing: they try something and report PASS or FAIL.

Testing provides an empirical feedback loop for development. That’s how testing keeps us safe. With tests, we know when things break. Without tests, coding can be dangerous.

<br>

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is a type of testing which is found at the bottom of the software testing pyramid. It involves breaking the codebase down into smaller parts (or units) and testing those in isolation.

<br>

## Reasons Why Unit Testing Matters

1. **They save you hours of debugging.**
When you have tests that your code needs to pass, you’re preventing bugs.
You’ll catch many of those little things, like syntax errors, or the wrong values getting passed to a function, that sometimes make it to the next phase in your pipeline. After you’ve written a bunch of code for an application, it will take you longer to find those small things compared to finding them immediately with your unit tests.

2. **They make you think about your code before/as you write it.**
Since you have to write each unit test, you really have to understand what the functionality is supposed to do.

3. **They help you write efficient code the first time, reducing the need for refactoring.**
Writing unit tests helps to keep your code simple because you write just enough code to pass the test. Having simple, easy to read, bug-resistant code in your first round of programming makes you more confident as a developer, and it makes your employers have more confidence in you.

4. **They give you documentation for the application.**
A unit test is a small piece of code that describes a user story or some kind of requirement. Over time, all of those small pieces of code add up to tell the story of how the entire application works.

<br>

Every major programming language has at least one test framework. Frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, Cucumber, and Jasmine.
However, the framework itself doesn’t make a test case “good” or “bad.” **You, as the tester, must know how to write good tests!**

<br>

## Understanding Jasmine

[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is a very popular JavaScript behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for unit testing JavaScript applications. It provides utilities that can be used to run automated tests for both synchronous and asynchronous code.

BDD is a testing approach derived from the Test-Driven Development (TDD) philosophy. **In BDD you write tests before writing actual code.**

### ARRANGE-ACT-ASSERT: A PATTERN FOR WRITING GOOD TESTS

So, if we intend to spend time writing tests, how can we write good tests? There’s a simple but powerful pattern to follow: **Arrange-Act-Assert**.

<br>

```javascript
// Here is an example of a Test Script

describe("addition()", function() {
  //ARRANGE
    let a = 2;
    let b = 2;
    let sum = 4;

  //ACT
    let result = addition(a,b);

  //ASSERT
    it("it should return 4", function(){
      expect(result).toEqual(sum);
    });
  });

```

Arrange-Act-Assert is a great way to structure test cases. The "AAA - pattern" forces tests to focus on independent, individual behaviors.

- It separates setup actions from the main actions.
- It requires test to make verifications and not merely run through motions.
- It prescribes an order of operations

<br>

#### The Pattern

1. **Arrange inputs and targets** -- Arrange steps should set up the test case. Does the test require any objects or special settings? Does it need to prep a database? Does it need to log into a web app? Handle all of these operations at the start of the test.
2. **Act on the target behavior** -- Act steps should cover the main thing to be tested. This could be calling a function or method, calling a REST API, or interacting with a web page. Keep actions focused on the target behavior.
3. **Assert expected outcomes** -- Act steps should elicit some sort of response. Assert steps verify the goodness or badness of that response. Sometimes, assertions are as simple as checking numeric or string values. Other times, they may require checking multiple facets of a system. Assertions will ultimately determine if the test passes or fails.

Notice how the pattern is not Arrange-Act-Assert-Act-Assert – After the first 'arrangement' all subsequent actions and assertions belong in separate tests!

Let’s look at how to apply the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in in JavaScript code, using the Jasmine testing framework.

## Create A Project

1. **Installation**

    From root project directory run

    ```node
    npm install --save-dev jasmine-node

    //  or if that does not work...
    npm install jasmin -g
    
    ```

>Note: For LINUX and or MacOS users -- you may need to run sudo for installing npm packages depending on your npm configuration.

<br>

2. **Add Script to package.json**

    This allows you to start a test by using `npm test`, or `jasmine` (We'll look at the 2 different results from these commands shortly.)

      ```javascript
      "scripts": {
          "test": "npx jasmine-node spec"
      }
      ```

<br>

3. **Initializing**

    To initialize a project for Jasmine from root project directory run

    ```node
    jasmine init
    ```

This `init` command will generate a file structure within a `spec` folder that lets Jasmine know where to look for tests. When you are done with the setup process you folder structure should look like this:

![File Structure](img/JasmineUnitTesting1.png)

Below is the content of a default `jasmine.json file`:

```javascript
{
  "spec_dir": "spec",
  "spec_files": [
    "**/*[sS]pec.js"
  ],
  "helpers": [
    "helpers/**/*.js"
  ],
  "stopSpecOnExpectationFailure": false,
  "random": true
}
```

- `spec_dir`: specifies where Jasmine looks for test files.
- `spec_files`: specifies the patterns of test files, by default all JS files that end with Spec or spec strings.
- `helpers`: specifies where Jasmine looks for helper files. Helper files are executed before specs and can be used to define custom matchers.
- `stopSpecOnExpectationFailure`: when set to true will immediately stop a spec on the first failure of an expectation (can be used as a CLI option via --stop-on-failure).
- `random`: when set to true Jasmine will pseudo-randomly run the test cases (can be used as a CLI option via --random).

<br>

## **Activity 1: Write First Unit test**

1. Now that Jasmine is setup, we can create our first project. A project using Jasmine has several components. Here's the project structure:

    - `helloWord.js` will contain our helloWord function we want to test. We must exported it for use in other files.
    - Spec folder that contains the `helloWord.spec.js` which contains the tests for the function helloWord.
    - `spec/support` folder which contains `jasmine.json`

<br>

2. Now let's run tests by simply running jasmine on the command line in the Bash terminal.

        jasmine

    The test should fail because it can't find the code for helloWorld(), or the spec for testing it.

    <br>

3. **First let's write our test:**
Go to the spec file and tell Jasmine where to look for the code. In `helloWorld.spec.js` require helloWorld.js. Build a test Spec using the "AAA pattern" -- Arrange-Act-Assert.

    - A spec declares a test case that belongs to a test suite. This is done by calling the Jasmine global function it()
    - `it()`takes two parameters -- the title of the spec (which describes the logic we want to test), and a function that implements the actual test case
    - A spec may contain one or more expectations. Each expectation is simply an assertion that can return either true or false.
    - For the spec to be passed, all expectations belonging to the spec have to be true otherwise the spec fails

    ```js
    const assert = require('assert');
    const helloWorld = require('../helloWorld.js');

    describe("helloWorld()", function() {
      //ARRANGE
      let greeting = 'Hello World';
      //ACT
      let result = helloWorld;
      //ASSERT
      it("it should return Hello World", function(){
        expect(result).toEqual(greeting);
      });
    });
    ```

    - The function `describe(string, function)`  has 2 parameters, and defines what we call a 'Test Suite', a collection of individual Test Specs.

    - The function `it(string, function)` also has 2 parameters, and defines an individual Test Spec, which contains one or more Test Expectations.

    - The `expect(actual)` expression is what we call an **Expectation**. In conjunction with a **Matcher** it describes an expected piece of behavior in the application.

    - The `matcher(expected)` expression does a boolean comparison with the expected value vs. the actual value passed to the expect function. If the check is false the spec fails.

<br>

4.  Next, we need to write our code and export it so if can be found by, and used in the test file.
In the root of your project create a new file called `helloWorld.js`

    ```js
    let helloWorld = function(){
        return 'Hello World';
      }

    module.exports = helloWorld;
    ```

<br>

5. And now, run the tests again. This time it should pass!


<br>

## **Activity 2: Unit test an Addition Function**

1. We want to create a function that returns the sum of 2 numbers, and test it. In the root of our project create a new file called `addition.js`.

<br>

2. In unit testing we first write our test before we code. So, in your `spec` folder create a new file called `addition.spec.js` , require `assert`, and import our (empty) `addition.js` file...

    ```javascript
    const assert = require('assert');
    const addition = require("../addition");
    ```

    - To add 2 numbers we need 2 parameters to hold our numbers -- this is the 'ARRANGE' part of out test.
    - Describe the expected result in the 'ACT' section.
    - In the `it()` function add the rest of the code to declare our test, and 'ASSERT' that our code produced the expected outcomes...

    ```js
    describe("addition()", function() {
        //ARRANGE
        let a = 2;
        let b = 2;
        let sum = 4;

        //ACT
        let result = addition(a,b);

        //ASSERT
        it("it should return 4", function(){
          expect(result).toEqual(sum);
        });
      });
    ```

    NOTE: Jasmine provides a rich set of built-in matchers. Let’s see some of the important ones:
    - toBe() for testing for identity,
    - toBeNull() for testing for null,
    - toBeUndefined() / toBeDefined() for testing for undefined / not undefined,
    - toBeNaN() for testing for NaN (Not A Number)
    - toEqual() for testing for equality,
    - toBeFalsy() / toBeTruthy() for testing for falseness / truthfulness etc.

    You can find the full list of Jasmine matchers from the [Jasmine docs](https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/matchers.html) at https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/matchers.html.

<br>

3. Now that we know what we want to achieve, let's build our function code in our `addition.js` file...

    ```js
    function addition(a,b){
        let sum = a + b;
        return sum;
    }

    module.exports = addition;
    ```

<br>

4. In the `Bash console` let's run the command `jasmine`. The test should pass and you should see green dots and output in the console that look like this...

    ```console
    $ jasmine
    Randomized with seed 42304
    Started
    .......

    7 specs, 0 failures
    Finished in 0.058 seconds
    Randomized with seed 42304 (jasmine --random=true --seed=42304)

    ```

5.  Next, in the same Bsh Console, run our custom command script `npm test`, and compare the output.
The test should pass and you should see green dots and output in the console that look like this...

    ```console
    $ npm test

    > savvy-starter@1.0.0 test C:\Users\jbest\Code\SavvyCoders\Testing-example
    > npx jasmine-node spec

    .......

    Finished in 0.01 seconds
    7 tests, 4 assertions, 0 failures, 0 skipped

    ```
