2. Navigate to your Class Activities repo
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal

```javascript
// ? log only the expressions that evaluate to true
14 > 8;
42 > 44;
1 > 1;

31 < 22;
9 < 13;
0 < 0;

12 >= 12.5;
60 >= 40;
2 >= 2;

12 <= 12.5;
14 <= 0.3;
5 <= 5;

3 === 3;
3 === "3";
"3" === "3";
3 === 4;

2 !== "2";
"2" !== "2";
2 !== 1;

"two" == 2;
2 == "2";
2 == 2;

3 != "three";
"3" != 3;
3 != 3;
