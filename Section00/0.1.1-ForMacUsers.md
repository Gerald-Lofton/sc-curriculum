# Setting Up your Development Environment (For Mac Users)

1. Install the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) if you do not already have it
2. Sign-up for [GitHub](https://github.com/). Follow the instructions below to generate a new SSH key for authentication.
3. Follow the directions in this link:
   [How to Configure Your Mac with Z Shell](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-configure-your-macos-terminal-with-zsh-like-a-pro-c0ab3f3c1156/)
4. Then, run the following commands in your terminal:
   1. `brew install node`
   2. `brew install git`
   3. `brew cask install visual-studio-code`
5. Check that you have installed everything correctly by running the following commands in your terminal:
   - `node -v`
     - you should see something like `v16.13.1` (the exact numbers may not match)
   - `git --version`
     - you should see something like `git version 2.27.0` (the exact numbers may not match)
   - `code`
     - this should launch a new VS Code window

## Generating a new SSH key
1. Go to your home screen in your terminal. This should have the `~` symbol.

2. Type `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"` into your terminal. Replace your_email@example.com with the email address that you used to create your GitHub account.

5. In your terminal type `ls -a`. This will display all of the folders on your computer. you should now see one called `.ssh`.

6. Navigate into this folder by typing `cd .ssh`. You should not see this folder name beside the `~`.

7. Type `ls` to list the contents of this folder. You will see at least two files. Both of these will start with ed25519 but one will be followed by `.pub`. These are the public and private keys that were created.

8. Print the contents of the public key that you created by typing `cat id_ed25519.pub`. You will see the name of your key, the public key (a string of random numbers and letters), and your email address printed to the terminal. Copy the entire message.

9. Go to GitHub and click on the profile button in the top right of your screen. In the drop down menu that appears click on `Settings`.
