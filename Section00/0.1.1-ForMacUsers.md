2. Sign-up for [GitHub](https://github.com/)
3. Follow the directions in this link:
   [How to Configure Your Mac with Z Shell](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-configure-your-macos-terminal-with-zsh-like-a-pro-c0ab3f3c1156/)
4. Then, run the following commands in your terminal:
   1. `brew install node`
   2. `brew install git`
   3. `brew cask install visual-studio-code`
5. Check that you have installed everything correctly by running the following commands in your terminal:
   - `node -v`
     - you should see something like `v16.13.1` (the exact numbers may not match)
   - `git --version`
     - you should see something like `git version 2.27.0` (the exact numbers may not match)
   - `code`
     - this should launch a new VS Code window
